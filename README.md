# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room is a client who wants to develop a web-based game, "Draw It or Lose It," that can be played on multiple platforms. 

The game requires at least one team, each with multiple players, and unique game and team names. Only one instance of the game can be active at any time. The game must be designed to function across multiple platforms. I particularly did well in creating the domain model by establishing a relationship between the Game, Team, and Player classes through inheritance. The process of working through a design document was helpful when developing the code because it helped me better understand the requirements and ensured that I did not miss anything. If I could revise any part of my work on these documents, I would review the Development Requirements table to ensure that I have provided adequate and comprehensive responses to each platform. It is crucial to consider the user's needs when designing software because it ensures that the final product meets the user's expectations, which ultimately leads to a better user experience. 
I approached designing the software by first identifying the client's requirements, then creating a domain model and a logical topology of the communication and storage aspects to understand the overall architecture. To analyze and design a similar software application in the future, I would use techniques such as UML diagrams and domain modeling. I would also work closely with the client to ensure that their needs are met.

Regarding the evaluation, Mac and Windows have low levels of expertise and time investment for development, while Linux requires the highest level of expertise and time investment. Linux is also the most cost-effective option and is known for its security and popularity, making it the preferred choice for web hosting services. Windows, compared to other operating systems, has a wider availability of software, is dominant in the market, and offers high resource requirements, quick loading times, and high user comfort. However, it has a high susceptibility to viruses and limited technical support. A server that is stationary and can be monitored in one location is preferable for the server-side, while mobile devices offer wider accessibility, improved compatibility, and cost-effectiveness for the client-side. 
However, they may be limited to only a few mobile devices and lack strong security. Macs can run Swift, which is a popular choice, along with helpful tools like Xcode. Linux is best suited for open-source languages and frameworks such as Ruby and Python, and it is recommended to use virtual machines to minimize security risks. Finally, Windows can run a variety of programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, making it a versatile option.
